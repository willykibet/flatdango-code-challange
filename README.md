# movie-ticketing

Flatdango is a simple web application that allows users to browse and purchase movie tickets for a local theater. The application retrieves movie data from a local server and displays it to the user, enabling them to see available movies, movie details, and buy tickets. This project serves as a basic movie ticket booking system with options to view movie information and interact with the ticket booking process.
